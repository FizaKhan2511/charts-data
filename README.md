# Statistical Crime Analysis

In this project, I analyzed crime statistics and created charts to visualize the data. I used JavaScript, the Document Object Model (DOM), and the Chart.js library to create interactive and visually appealing charts. 


By analyzing and visualizing crime statistics, I hope to contribute to a better understanding of crime patterns and trends. Please feel free to explore the charts
